# Weather Model

This README provides information about the Mongoose schema used for the Weather API, specifically the structure of the Weather model that stores weather-related data.

## Overview

The Weather model represents the weather data for various cities, capturing essential metrics such as temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and descriptions of the weather conditions.

## Schema Definition

The Weather schema is defined using Mongoose and includes the following fields:

- city: String
  - Description: The name of the city for which the weather data is recorded.
  - Required: Yes

- temperature: Number
  - Description: The current temperature in the city.
  - Required: Yes

- tempMax: Number
  - Description: The maximum temperature recorded for the day.
  - Required: Yes

- tempMin: Number
  - Description: The minimum temperature recorded for the day.
  - Required: Yes

- description: String
  - Description: A textual description of the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
  - Required: Yes

- date: Date
  - Description: The date when the weather data was recorded.
  - Default: Automatically set to the current date and time when a new record is created.

## Usage

This schema is typically used in conjunction with an Express.js application to store and manage weather data. The model can be used to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting weather records in a MongoDB database.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the Weather model in your application:

```javascript
const Weather = require('./models/Weather');
 these are the sample datas stored in the mongodb
// Creating a new weather record
const newWeather = new Weather({
    city: "New York",
    temperature: 25,
    tempMax: 30,
    tempMin: 20,
    description: "Partly cloudy"
});

newWeather.save()
    .then(() => console.log("Weather data saved!"))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error saving weather data:", err));

// Querying weather data
Weather.find({ city: "New York" })
    .then(data => console.log("Weather data:", data))
    .catch(err => console.error("Error fetching weather data:", err));
npm start
 then the database will be connected and in the terminal it will show Server running on port 8084
Database connected!
below that the datas will be shown in the tereminal.
